    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 sheets nori seaweed sheets</li>
        <li>2 pieces imitation crab legs</li>
        <li>Â½ (3 ounce) package cream cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
 
       <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
       <li>Bring rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir in rice vinegar and salt. Allow to cool completely.</li>
       <li>Lay out seaweed sheets. Moisten hands with water, then spread cooled rice evenly on each sheet, leaving a 1/2-inch gap along one edge, lengthwise. Arrange strips of cucumber, imitation crabmeat, and cream cheese on top of the rice in a straight line along the side opposite the gap. Roll up sushi from the toppings to the seaweed sheet's exposed end.</li>
       <li>Using a sharp wet knife, slice each roll into 5 or 6 pieces. Serve with minced ginger on the side.</li>
       
    </ol>
